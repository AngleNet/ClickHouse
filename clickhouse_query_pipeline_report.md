## Executive Summary

This technical report provides a comprehensive analysis of ClickHouse's query pipeline architecture, covering the complete journey from SQL parsing to distributed execution. ClickHouse employs a sophisticated multi-stage pipeline that leverages columnar storage, vectorized processing, and distributed computing to achieve exceptional analytical performance.

## 1. Query Pipeline Overview

ClickHouse's query execution follows a multi-stage pipeline architecture:

```
SQL Query → Parser → AST → Analyzer → Query Plan → Pipeline → Execution
```

### 1.1 Pipeline Components
- **Parser**: Converts SQL text into Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
- **Analyzer**: Semantic analysis, type checking, and optimization
- **Query Planner**: Generates logical and physical execution plans
- **Pipeline Builder**: Constructs processing pipeline with processors
- **Execution Engine**: Executes pipeline with data streaming

## 2. AST Construction and Parsing

### 2.1 SQL Parser Architecture
ClickHouse uses a custom recursive descent parser that:
- Supports standard SQL with ClickHouse-specific extensions
- Handles complex nested queries and CTEs
- Provides detailed error reporting with position information
- Supports various SQL dialects and compatibility modes

### 2.2 AST Structure
The Abstract Syntax Tree represents:
- **Expressions**: Functions, operators, literals, column references
- **Statements**: SELECT, INSERT, CREATE, ALTER operations
- **Clauses**: WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING
- **Joins**: INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL with ON/USING conditions

### 2.3 Parser Features
- **Streaming**: Processes queries without loading entire text
- **Memory Efficient**: Minimal memory allocation during parsing
- **Extensible**: Plugin architecture for custom functions and operators
- **Multi-threaded**: Parallel parsing for large batch queries

## 3. Query Analysis and Optimization

### 3.1 Semantic Analysis
The analyzer performs:
- **Name Resolution**: Resolves table/column names to storage references
- **Type Checking**: Validates data types and implicit conversions
- **Privilege Checking**: Verifies user permissions for accessed objects
- **Dependency Analysis**: Identifies table and function dependencies

### 3.2 Query Optimization
ClickHouse implements advanced optimization techniques:

#### 3.2.1 Logical Optimizations
- **Predicate Pushdown**: Moves WHERE conditions closer to data source

- **Constant Folding**: Evaluates constant expressions at compile time
- **Join Reordering**: Optimizes join order based on cardinality estimates

#### 3.2.2 Physical Optimizations
- **Index Selection**: Chooses optimal indexes for query execution
- **Partition Pruning**: Eliminates irrelevant partitions
- **Storage Optimization**: Selects appropriate storage formats
- **Parallelization**: Determines optimal parallelism levels

## 4. Pipeline Construction

### 4.1 Query Plan Generation
The query planner creates a tree of execution nodes:
- **Source Nodes**: Table scans, index scans
- **Transform Nodes**: Filters, projections, aggregations
- **Join Nodes**: Various join algorithms (hash, merge, nested loop)
- **Sort Nodes**: Sorting operations with spill-to-disk capability

### 4.2 Pipeline Architecture
ClickHouse's pipeline consists of:
- **Processors**: Individual processing units that transform data
- **Ports**: Input/output connections between processors
- **Chunks**: Data batches flowing through the pipeline
- **Headers**: Schema information for data chunks

### 4.3 Processor Types

### 6.2 Distributed Query Processing
```
Client → Coordinator → Shard Nodes → Result Aggregation → Client
```

#### 6.2.1 Query Distribution
- **Query Rewriting**: Transforms distributed queries for shards
- **Shard Selection**: Determines which shards to query
